            <h2>About</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Welcome to the personal portfolio! I would like to introduce myself. 
            My name is Chase Clark. I am a full stack developer, currently working 
            full time in the beautiful state of Utah. I am a very active person 
            with a passion for music and technology. My favorite technical fields 
            are robotics, AI and websites! </p>
            </div>

            <div id="skills">
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>I specialize in full stack web development. 
            I have been actively building software and  static websites since I was a high schooler.
             I enjoy front end development and visual displays. 
             I find command lines boring to look at and I feel that visual design 
             and GUI enhance any software project. </p>

            </div>
            <p>My languages of choice are Javascript and Python, CSS and HTML. 
             I have worked with other programming languages like PHP and C++ but
              enjoy Javascript and Python 
              because of their beautiful and easy to type nature.  </p>
